# coronavirus-pygame

**To run this game, you need to have installed in your PC the Python Lib Pygame**

`pip install pygame`
.   
.  
  
**With this base, you can do so many other games!**

*1. There's some issues, but I'll improve the code and its documentation in the next days.*

*2. I did almost all from my logic knowledge in Python. So, I used few Classes from Pygame.*

*3. I will replace all images from the game. These are just placeholder for while.

*4. My English isn't good, so, probably you will see grammatical errors. But, focus on the code!!!*
  
*5. Let me know what do you think about this game. Send-me a message at my instagram @noobpythonbr, I will reply you :)*
